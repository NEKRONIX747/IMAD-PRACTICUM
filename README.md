For this application I have designed an app that allows a user to input song names as well as artist names ratings and comments to create a playlist this is don’t via a input text box all data that is input is stored in 4 different parallel arrays these arrays have suitable names and are easy and understandable there are also 2 screens in my application these 2 screens consist of a main screen as well as a details screen. 
The main screen allows the user to input data that is then stored in their corresponding arrays. These arrays hold the data to be displayed later. There is also error handling where a user cannot input a number larger than 5 for ratings and less than 0 for ratings. There is also implementation of a function that allows the user to navigate between the 2 screens effortlessly and a button that allows the user to exit the application when they want. 
The second screen is a display screen. This screen allows the user to view their playlist and what’s in it this shows all the data that is stored in the parallel arrays. There are three buttons on this screen. The first button is the details button which shows the playlists and all data corresponding. The second button is to let users see the average rating of songs across all playlists. This is done using a loop and so is the previous button.The last button on this screen allows a user to go back to the main screen which they can then exit from there or add a new playlist to the application. 

 

  
This is my main activity screen this is the screen I used to do all the arrays as well as the switching of screens and where all the declarations and code are to input the song data.
 
 
These two screenshots are my xml file for the main screen I decided to use a linear layout as they look a bit better for this specific application.
  
These two screenshots are from the end screen or details screen as you can see my playlist displays as well as the average rating is also being displayed.
 
This is the blank template of the two screenshots above.
 
This is the first screen and as you can see the user inputs data, adds it to a playlist and then can navigate to the next screen. There is also a functioning exit button.
   
This is my second .kt screen where you can see the inner workings of how they were all displayed.
 
This is my xml layout where I went with a scroll view as quite a bit of data can be stored and you will need to scroll to see it all 
 
This is where I have added the exit button 
This is my main screen where I did some error handling
